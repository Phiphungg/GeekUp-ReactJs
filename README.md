# React + Vite
=======
This is the file in which I will describe my approach to this project.

When reviewing the project provided by your company, the first thing I do is analyze:
What components the website consists of.
How many pages the website has and whether navigating between pages requires a reload.
Whether each page includes animations, what effects are used, and whether these are frequently repeated.
How many images and icons need to be downloaded for each page.
Which APIs the website calls, and I review the API data to understand their relationships.

This project is built with ReactJS using Vite, which allows for easier project setup and library integration.

For the UI, I used TailwindCSS to simplify development and keep the styles clean and efficient.

During development, I used DevTools to easily measure dimensions and check for errors.

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

For routing, I used BrowserRouter to enable smooth page transitions without requiring a full page reload. This helps the website run faster.

To handle API requests, I chose Axios because it's easier to manage and more user-friendly.

Regarding project setup and during the coding process, there were some shortcomings, as I was learning while building this project. I also relied on Google to search for solutions when I encountered issues.

When setting up tools and frameworks, I typically refer to their official websites and follow their documentation.

My product is currently missing a table of contents, as I forgot to include it and havenâ€™t had time to analyze and complete that part.

There are definitely some imperfections in my code, and I hope your company can understand.
